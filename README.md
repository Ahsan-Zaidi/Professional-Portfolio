## Description

🔍Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

I have created a professional portfolio, the purpose is to engage potential clients in order to get hired as a professional web developer.

✋ [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Ahsan-Zaidi/Professional-Portfolio)


✋ [Deployed App](https://ahsan-zaidi.github.io/Professional-Portfolio/)


## ✋User Story

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## ✋Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
